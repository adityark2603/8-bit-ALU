# 8-bit-ALU

An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) performs arithmetic and logic operations on binary numbers. These operations include: 
1. Arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
2. Logic operations: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and comparisons like less than, equal to, and greater than
3. Bitwise operations: Shift operations and other bitwise operations
4. Data transfer: Transferring data to and from registers
5. Data checks: Checking data for special values
6. Status outputs: Providing information about the current or previous operation



In this project, I've chosen my 8-bit-ALU to perform Logical operations (AND, OR), Operations involving comparisons (Set less than) and Arithmetic Operations (Addition, Subtraction).  

Boolean Expressions for the operations used in this project:
1. AND -> y = a & b
2. OR -> y = a | b
3. Addition -> y = a + b
4. Subtraction -> y = a - b
5. Set Less than -> a < b
